I'm a **ECE Master's student** at **Georgia Tech** with a passion for robotics, non-linear control systems, reinforcement learning, and path planning. My journey through both electrical and computer engineering has allowed me to work on a variety of robotics projects. I'm currently exploring advanced control techniques and real-time path-finding optimization in dynamic environments.

### ðŸŽ¯ Research Interests
- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**
- **Human Robot Interactions**
- **Non-Linear Control Systems**
- **Path and Motion Planning**

### ðŸŒ± Currently Working On
- Researching methods to optimize learning based control on user preferences for more effective learning.
- Path planning and optimization algorithms for safe and ideal trajectory.
